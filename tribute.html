				<h2>Some quotes</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals.
						That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.
					</li>
					<li>It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. It's all a game of angles.
					</li>
					<li>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them.
					</li>
					<li>Little short strokes. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.
					</li>
					<li>No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?
					</li>
					<li>Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.
					</li>
					<li>The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. We'll make some happy little bushes here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch
						brush.
					</li>
