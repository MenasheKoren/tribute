				<h2>Some background and quotes</h2>

				<ul>

					</li>
					<li>He joined the US Air Force at 18, finishing with the rank of master sergeant.

					<li>When he did his service in Alaska, the snow and the mountains were to be a strong inffluence in his art.
					</li>
					<li>He figured out how to make quick paintings during his breaks. He saw that he made more money selling the works than in the Air Force and left to devote his life to his art.
					</li>
					<li>He eventually reached world fame that lasted well beyond his death in <cite>The Joy of Painting</cite>.
